    <div class="FAQ">
        <div>
            <h5>Do you do airport pickups?</h5>
            <p>Yes. We service the entire Twin Cities to and from MSP Airport. We have vehicles stationed just
                outside the airport and can arrive at the pre-arranged taxis door within 3-5 minutes of a booking
                request.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5>Can you accommodate my wheelchair?</h5>
            <p>Yes. Thank You America is committed to making transportation accessible for all riders. We are the only
                taxi company
                in the Twin Cities with round-the-clock wheelchair van service. Our drivers are STS certified with
                special training in transporting passengers with special needs, first aid, and more.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5>Are your drivers/vehicles insured?</h5>
            <p>Every vehicle is covered by our fleet-wide insurance policy. We choose to carry a policy with
                limits high above the standard set by the state to ensure you are protected no matter what. Many other
                taxi and ride sharing companies have drivers secure their own auto insurance, leaving passengers at
                great risk if the driver is under-insured or not insured at the time of the accident.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5>How do you maintain your vehicles?</h5>
            <p>The average taxi travels over 40,000 miles per year, so regular service is essential for safe and
                reliable transportation. All our vehicles are serviced every 3,500 miles and receive thorough
                inspections from our in-house mechanics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h5>What do I do if I left something in one of your vehicles?</h5>
            <p>As a local company, we make it easy to find what you left behind. Simpy call our lost and found
                department directly at <a href="">763-592-6481</a> for help locating your lost or missing item. We'll
